    desc: 'As far as standards and protocols are concerned, the story of
      the Internet is one of free software. But its popularity and potential make big firms jealous.
      They would like to claim control of it by establishing closed code in locked systems
      that are not interoperable.
      To keep the Internet faithful to the founding principles which led to its success,
      it is important that there should be free apps on the Internet, that is to say,
      apps with opensource codes, accessible under free license.'
  ethic:
    title: Ethics
    desc: 'We wish to support a participative and
      independent Internet. Exploitation, surveillance, censorship, and data
      appropriation are trends we refuse in favor of transparency (integrity),
      clearly displayed policies for users of the various services, and the refusal of all forms of discrimination.'

    desc: 'The genius of the Internet must dwell at the margins of the network
      in a peer-to-peer sharing dynamic, to avoid creating a Minitel 2.0. To insure equality
      for all concerned, from citizens to businesses, monopolies must not only be excluded, but also
      prevented from monopolizing personal or public data. Through clear
      tutorials explaining how to propagate free solutions for establishing a fairer Internet,
      we intend to facilitate the spreading of codes and a diversification of usages.'

    desc: 'Through the services we provide, we promote a model
      based on cost participation, resource sharing, and accessibility
      for the largest number of people.
      Any abuse will thus be avoided, for we all remain fully aware of our common interests.
      This model also has an educational purpose since, as we document the roll-out of services,
      many users will in their turn be able to share those resources.'

        <strong>who no longer control their digital existence</strong>:
        their behaviour is continually dissected and analysed so that they can be better targeted by

          that Internet giants have been forced to communicate
          this data (sometimes extremely private: emails from Gmail,
          photos shared on Facebook, Skype conversations,
          smartphone locations, etc.) to government services.

          Finally, The lack of diversity of the giants means
          they can track many people who are unaware that there may be alternatives,
